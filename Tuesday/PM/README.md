# Tuesday Afternoon 

## Drawing with Code

### warm up (~30mins)

- Group draw warmup - one person plays computer and draws on the whiteboard, everyone gets one instruction to ask them to do.
- The simplest life-drawing code ever. Copy my super simple example (type not copy and paste!) and let's do a quick drawing.
- Warm up complete. You have exercised your drawing and coding skills and are ready to design your own drawing tool!

### create a new drawing tool (~1 hour) 

- Create a new drawing tool! Using the skills you've learnt this morning, create a new drawing tool, don't be afraid to experiment but also simple can be effective!
- There are two rules: 
  - There must be text instructions on how to use your tool on screen! Other people need to be able to use your new tool without you telling them how it works.
  - Your code must be fully commented. Other people will need to understand your code without you being there to explain it. Use double forward slash // to comment
- Here's a basic example to start from: [simple_paint_01](https://github.com/ashleyjamesbrown/NYI/blob/main/Tuesday/PM/simple_paint_01/simple_paint_01.pde)
- Let's test the new tools, draw the still life (bowl of fruit)
- then ... coffee break! - help yourself to fruit :-)

### improve a drawing tool (~1 hour)

- Now, you are going to take someone else's code. Improve it or use it to create something new!
- Update instructions on how to use.
- Also document changes in the code. 
- Life drawing session, using someone else's tool and auto-pose suggester.
- Exhibition!

### challenges and ideas

- **Pen nib**. Explore different shape 'nibs' for your tool
  - Natural? Does your pen copy a real brush? 
  - Random? Does the brush use random to vary the size or shape? 
  - Spraypaint? Can you use a for loop to draw multiple points like spraypaint or splatter?
  - Calligraphy - try making your brush a thin rectangle, try changing the angle using rotate()
  - Connect the dots (simple). Draw a line from last mouse position to current position (pmouseX, pmouseY)
  - Connect the dots (advanced). Store positions into an array and draw them each frame.
- **Paper.** Explore what you're drawing on.
  - Texture. Can you use a for loop in setup to give the paper some texture?
  - Photo. Can you import an image to use as the background?
  - Gradient. Use a for loop in setup to create a gradient to draw on.
- **Colour.** What colours are you using?
  - Can you copy the background colour from some real paper/canvas?
  - Can you use opacity/transparency? Add a fourth value to your colour to change transparency (Red, Green, Blue, Opacity)
  - Can you randomise the colour of the pen?
- **Special FX**
  - Symmetry. Can your pen draw on two halves of the canvas at the same time?
  - Time. Does anything change over time? Play with replacing a colour value with seconds()%255

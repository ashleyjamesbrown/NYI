# Tuesday Afternoon 

## Drawing with Code

### warm up (~30mins)

- Group draw warmup - one person plays computer and draws on the whiteboard, everyone gets one instruction to ask them to do.
- The simplest life-drawing code ever. Copy my super simple example (type not copy and paste!) and let's do a quick drawing.
- Warm up complete. You have exercised your drawing and coding skills and are ready to design your own drawing tool!

### create a new drawing tool (~1 hour) 

- Create a new drawing tool! Using the skills built up in the first 
- Include instructions on how to use
- Document your code
- Life drawing session (using someone else's drawing tool)
- coffee break!

### improve a drawing tool (~1 hour)

- Take someone else's tool. Improve it or use it to create something new!
- Update instructions on how to use.
- Also document changes in the code. 
- Life drawing session (using someone else's drawing tool)
- Exhibition!

### Challenges and Ideas

- **Pen nib**. Explore different shape 'nibs' for your tool
  - Natural? Does your pen copy a real brush? 
  - Random? Does the brush use random to vary the size or shape? 
  - Spraypaint? Can you use a for loop to draw multiple points like spraypaint or splatter?
  - Calligraphy - try making your brush a thin rectangle, try changing the angle using rotate()
  - Connect the dots (simple). Draw a line from last mouse position to current position (pmouseX, pmouseY)
  - Connect the dots (advanced). Store positions into an array and draw them each frame.
- **Paper.** Explore what you're drawing on.
  - Texture. Can you use a for loop in setup to give the paper some texture?
  - Photo. Can you import an image to use as the background?
  - Gradient. Use a for loop in setup to create a gradient to draw on.
- **Special FX**
  - Symmetry. Can your pen draw on two halves of the canvas at the same time? 
- **Time**
  - Does anything change over time? Play with replacing a colour value with seconds()%255
